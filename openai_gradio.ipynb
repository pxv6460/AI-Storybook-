      "\n",
      "“Who are you?” Luna asked, kneeling down.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m Benny, and I live in this forest. The river is drying up, and the trees are dying! We need to save our home!” He thumped his little paw on the ground.\n",

      "\n",
      "Without a second thought, Luna took Benny’s paw, and they dashed through the trees. They climbed over mossy logs and skipped across bubbling brooks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, they reached the Old Oak. Its trunk was wide and twisted, covered in vibrant green moss. But before they could enter, a grumpy old owl, perched on a branch, hooted. \n",
      "\n",
      "“Who dares disturb my slumber?” he grumbled.\n",

      "\n",
      "They raced to the riverbank, where the dried-up stream lay before them. With a swirl of magic from the crystal, water gushed forth, glimmering under the sun. The trees sighed with relief, their leaves dancing joyfully.\n",

      "“Thank you, Luna and Benny!” the forest sang, vibrant and alive again.\n",
